                <div class='paragraph'><p> I have loved photography ever since I was a baby clown. My 
                parents gave me a camera for my third birthday and I have had 
                a camera in my hand ever since. I got my bachelor's degree in 
                Photography with an emphasis in Fast Food back in 2010 
                and I have over 30 years of professional experience. I have won 
                the Golden Chicken Nugget Award 7 years consecutively for my 
                photo contributions. </p></div>
                <div class='paragraph'><p> One of my favorite things about photography is the opportunity 
                I have to watch people during their special moments. Watching a 
                couple get married inside of the PlayPlace or witnessing a child
                take their first bite of a Hot 'n Spicy McChicken really touches 
                my soul and inspires me to be better.</p></div>
                <div class='paragraph'><p> Outside of photography I am a part time private detective 
                trying to catch the hamburglar. I also enjoy watching Netflix, 
                playing with my dog, and practicing the banjo.</p></div>
                <div class='paragraph'><p> Thank you so much for looking through my work and I look 
                forward to serving you in the future!</p></div>
