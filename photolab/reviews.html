                        <p class = 'paragraph'> Ronald McDonald was very professional.
                        He may look like a clown but he acts like a gentleman. His 
                        prices are also extremey fair, I only had to pay him two 
                        Happy Meals and he was ready to go! Highly Recommended!

                        <p class = 'paragraph'> Ronald McDonald is my hero! He is so 
                        brave with his pictures and he truly treats photography as 
                        an art. The photos he took of me while I was drinking my 
                        large Sprite were impeccable and so is he! BOOK HIM NOW!!!!!!

                        family portrait in the local McDonald's and my 37 kids were 
                        uncontrollable. Thankfully, Ronald is a hilarious clown and 
                        was able to capture my children's attention with his clownish 
                        charm. I will never change my photographer again!

                        on an egg McMuffin and Ronald didn't hesitate to give me the 
                        Heimlich maneuver and dislodge the egg in my throat. He even
                        took a picture of me afterwards for free. A real 
                        stand up guy!

                        married inside of McDonald's, things became very stressful. 
                        After all the craziness, our photographer cancelled on us 
                        last minute and we were about to call off the wedding 
                        completely. Out of the blue, Ronald gave us a call and 
                        offered his services. He saved the day!

                        He was an excellent student and never missed a class. 
                        He has taken some of the most impressive McDonald's building
                        pictures that I have ever seen. I wrote a whole textbook about 
                        it.

                        McDonald's as much as I do. Ronald will literally change
